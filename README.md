# Stock Hawk

In this project, you will productionize an app, taking them from a functional state to a production-ready state. To do this, you will find and handle error cases, add accessibility features, allow for localization, add widgets, and add a library.

This project will read Stock details from Yahoo Finance API's and create a list of stocks you want to follow. It uses charts to show historical data for a particular stock. You'll also create a list collection widget that displays stock values on home screen.

Following libraries are used in the project :
